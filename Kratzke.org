** I. basic concepts
- tax as "source of revenue" for government
- tariffs
- import tariffs
- export tariffs
- consumers v. producers
- domestic v. foreign
- Article 1, § 9, cl. 5
		- no inter-state tariffs
- 
- government monopoly
- government enters an industry, then outlaws competition in that industry
- lotteries, park access, liquor stores
- 
- tax citizens
- citizens v. consumers
- noncitizens, nonresidents
- "tax base"
		- what it is the government should tax
- "head tax"
		- tax on a specific group - citizen, resident, voter, etc.
		- objectively equal ($1000 all citizens), but subjectively unequal ($1000 is nothing to some citizens, is a LOT to other citizens)
		- poll tax, 24th Amendment
- consumption tax
		- tax "consumption"
		- sales tax
		- excise tax
		- value added tax (VAT)
		- sales tax
				- tax on sale
				- usually a flat %
				- NOT on "what people "SAVE""
				- more burdensome to those who spend more on [items subject to a sales tax]
				- objectively equal (same % for everyone)
				- "regressive effect": 2 people; one richer; spend same objective amount; the poorer is taxed on more % of his income; the richer is taxed on less % of his income
				- Ramsey principle
						- taxes on items whose demand is "inelastic" raises the most revenue
						- "inelastic demand": amount of tax does NOT change the demand
						- lifesaving drug - doesn't matter how expensive; people MUST buy
						- "distort": the mere [presence of tax] changes people's spending behavior
						- taxes on inelastic goods distorts LITTLE
  - excise tax
				- sales tax only on certain class of goods
				- basically, head tax but based on [identity/grouping of the item bought] (not based on [identity/grouping of the purchaser])
				- tax on luxury items
				- luxury goods have highly elastic demand
				- excise tax on "sin" purchases like cigarettes and alcohol
		- value added tax
				- tax on all stages of a sale
				- not just on consumer, but every stage of production
- 
- progressive consumption tax
- Schanz-Haig-Simons concept of income
- "wealth"
- "consumption"
- "saving"
- "progressive": more consumption -> more tax
- 
- wealth tax
- estate tax
		- tax on estates of decedents
- property tax
		- tax on people who HOLD property
- 
- wage tax
- "payroll tax"
		- flat % tax on all wages, no matter the actual amount
- 
		- social security tax, medicare tax
- regressive effect
		- income above "ceiling", effective rate, lower than effective rate of income below ceiling
- 
- Income tax
- "income" as "tax base"
- "deductions"
		- adjustments, reductions
- hard to avoid: have to NOT make money
** II. taxing income
- "personal income tax"
- "corporate income tax", "estate tax", "gift tax"
- title 26 of USC is the IRC
		-
** III. Some definitions
- "tax base"
		- the thing that the government is taxing
- "all income"
- "taxable income"
		- "gross income" minus [§62 deductions], minus (either "standard deduction" or "itemized deductions")
- "tax formula"
		- [[file:tax formula.png]]
		- line in the tax formula: "the line"
				- "above the line", "below the line"
				- gross income to adjusted gross income
		- "below the line"
				- for you to deduct a "medical expense", you must've spent at least 10% of your AGI (below the line)
		- "credit"
		- non-refundable credits
				- cannot reduce tax liability below 0
		- refundable credits
				- CAN reduce tax liability below 0 -> govt pays you! lol
- 
- "progressive"
- "declining marginal utility of money"
- $1 is nothing to millionaire, a lot to a poor person
- "equal sacrifice"
- "redistribute income"
- tax brackets
- married, joint
		- [[file:married, joint old.png]]
		- [[file:married, join new.png]]
- unmarried
		- [[file:unmarried old.png]]
		- [[file:unmarried new.png]]
- "progressive tax brackets"
		- higher taxable income, higher tax rates
- "regressive tax"
		- higher taxable income, less tax rate
- "flat tax"
		- one same tax rate, ALL income levels
- "effective tax rate"
		- [amount ultimately paid as tax]/[total income]
		- "net capital gain" v. "ordinary income"
- "marginal tax rate"
		- the rate at which the next/last dollar is taxed
		- determines cost/value of working more, get benefit rather than salary, etc.
- "tax incidence"
		- who ACTUALLY bears the burden of a tax?
		- "direct tax": burden CAN'T be transferred - head tax
		- "indirect tax": burden CAN be transferred - excise tax
				- landowner charges rent 1. govt imposes real property tax. landowner charges higher rent 2. Ultimately, tenants are paying the real propert ytax
- "upside down nature of deductions and exclusions"
		- the value of another dollar earned: $1 - $1*(marginal tax rate)
		- the value of next dollar deducted: $1 is received by charity, donor only gives up $1 - $1*(marginal tax rate)
		- 1% marginal tax rate: donor gives up 99 cents to give $1 value to charity
		- 99% marginal tax rate: donor gives up 1 cent to give $1 value to charity
		- "upside-downness" of incentives
		- I THINK it just means:
		- tax-writers intended "the more you earn, the more you pay"
		- but, another way to look at it is:
		- "the more you earn, [the more you deduct, the more you benefit]"
		- so, richer people go apeshit for deductions
		- ultimately, people "earn less", meaning tax revenue is lower
		- kind of perverse ...?
		- fuck taxers
- 
- exclusions from gross income
- "gross income"
- "accessions to wealth"
- things that are "accessions to wealth" but NOT "gross income"
		- employer-provided health insurance §106
		- life insurance proceeds §101
		- interest from state or local bonds §103
		- various employee fringe benefits §§132, 129, 119
- encourages people to take these things, since these are not taxed
- 
- "deductions" from "taxable income"
- "deduction"
		- if you do X with your money,
		- we'll let you pay less taxes by "lowering" your taxable income
		- reduces income that's otherwise subject to income tax
- "exclusion from gross income" v. "deduction from taxable income/adjusted gross income"
- 
- Alternative minimum tax
- "AMT"
- you must pay the higher of (1) regular tax and (2) AMT
- you have to pay AT LEAST this amount!
- 
- credits against tax liability
- "credit"
- credits are for things like:
		- certain group of people (low income)
		- behavior: spend money on childcare
		- both
- 
- "right side up" nature of tax credits
- something about: using credits (rather than deductions), benefit poor people more than rich people
- 
- Income phaseouts and deduction caps
- goal: tax poor people less, without taxing rich people less
- "phaseout"
- "cap"
- deduction for interest paid on qualified education loans §219
		- cap: $2500
		- phaseout:
				- you make less than 20k -> can deduct full 2500
				- you make 20k-40k -> can deduct 2000
				- you make 40k-60k -> can deduct 1500
				- you make 60k-80k -> can deduct 1000
				- you make 80k-120k -> can deduct 500
				- you make 120k+ -> can deduct 0 (can't deduct at all)
- what kind of taxpayer would benefit most from §219? what kind of taxpayer would benefit the least?
- phaseouts and caps exist for both credits and deductions
- 
- A word about "employment taxes"
- "employment taxes"
		- tax that everyone pays on wages they get from employers
		- social security tax, medicare tax
- self employed, "self-employment taxes"
- eligibility is NOT based on wealth or need
- EVERYONE is to benefit from these programs
** IV. Layout of the code
- Internal Revenue Code
- title 26 of USC
- (1) statutes
- (2) regulations by Department of the Treasury
- "§61" really means "26 USC §61"
- regulation shorthand
		- "1"
		- related code section
- Reg. § 61-8
		- a regulation
		- related to §61
		- the one was that declared 8th
		- rephrase: the 8th regulation on §61

** V. Not all income is taxed alike
- "accession to wealth"
- "gross income"
- different types of "accession to wealth" are taxed differently
		- "long term capital gains"
				- gain on sale of property that a taxpayer owned for more than 1 year
		- dividend income
		- wage/salary income
		- interest income from state/local bonds
		- ordinary income
- "character" of income
		- ordinary income v. long-term capital gain income
- 
- 3 levels of tax law (analysis)
		- (1) statute and regulations
		- (2) policies of IRC
		- (3) income tax in one specific society (US, GB, Sweden, etc.)

** VI. Illustration of the tax formula
*** scenario
- Bill and Mary are husband and wife.
- They have two children, Thomas who is 14 and Stephen who is 10.
- Bill works as a manager for a large retailer.
- Last year, he earned a salary of $80,000.
- His employer provided the family with health insurance that cost $14,000.
- Mary is a school administrator who earned a salary of $75,000.
- Her employer provided her a group term life insurance policy with a death benefit of $50,000; her employer paid $250 to provide her this benefit.
- Their respective employers deducted employment taxes from every paycheck and paid each of them the balance.
- In addition to the above items, Bill and Mary own stock in a large American corporation, and that corporation paid them a dividend of $500.
- Bill and Mary later sold that stock for $10,000; they had paid $8000 for it several years ago.
- Bill and Mary have a joint bank account that paid interest of $400.
- Bill and Mary paid $4300 for daycare for Stephen.
- They also paid $3000 of interest on a student loan that Bill took out when he was in college.
- What is Bill and Mary’s tax liability? Assume that they will file as married filing jointly.

7) "effective tax rate"

** VII. Sources of tax law and role of courts
- sources, in order of hierarchy:
		- (1) Constitution
		- (2) IRC (statutes), courts, IRC can disagree with non-SCOTUS
		- (3) regulations of Secretary of Treasur
		- (4) revenue ruling by IRS
				- "revenue rulings"
				- "revenue procedure"
				- "private letter ruling"
		- (5) IRS's other statements
				- "technical advice memoranda"
				- "notices"
- binding or not?
- binding on all? or binding on only that one party discussed?
** VIII. Some income tax policy and some income tax principles
- fairness and equity
		- "horizontal equity"
				- equal accessions to wealth, same income tax
		- "vertical equity"
				- different accessions to wealth, different income tax
		- "administrative feasibility"
- enforcement of the tax laws and court review
		- IRS is part of Department of the Treasury
		- IRS enforces federal tax code
		- IRS has its own pprocess
		- but when it's time to take things out of IRS and to a court, 3 options:
		- (1) tax court
		- (2) court of claims (claims against US)
		- (3) Federal district court
- "tax expenditures"
		- if you're doing something we like, you don't have to pay tax on related income or spending
		- fex: qualified adoption expenses income § 137; qualified adoption spending § 36C

** IX. What we tax: what is income?
- "income": money I get (work at a job, invest money)?
- what about lottery income?
- A and B have same wage. B wins $1m in a lottery
- should they have the "same income"?
- point of defining "income": treat like taxpayers alike
- are A and B alike?
- No
		- B has much greater "capacity to consume or save"
- so, we want to treat A and B differently
- so, "income" can NOT just involve (1) fruits of labor and (2) investment
- "income" should relate to: (1) spending and (2) saving
- "personal income"
		- (1) actual "consumption" (how much spent)
		- (2) addition to "store of property rights" (how much saved)
		- this is the Schanz-Haig-Simons formula
- Income = Consumption + addition to the store of property rights
- consumption = Income - addition to the store of property rights
- employer gives W-2 (fruits of labor)
- bank gives 1099-INT (interest income (one form of investment))
- mp: "income", "consumption", and "addition to property rights" are RELATIVE TERMS
- 
*** Some obvious or not-so-obvious implications of the SHS definition of "income"
- "fruits of labor FOR THIS YEAR" and "ADDITION to property rights THIS YEAR"
- taxed in INCREMENT, not CUMULATION/NET WORTH/AGGREGATE
- "basis"
		- purpose: make sure that "increment to wealth" is taxed, NOT "accumulated wealth"
- 
**** taxing income is taxing consumption plus increments to the POWER to consume
- "wealth": unexercised power to consume
- "putting more money in bank account": consuming in the future rather than now
- inflation -> $1, consuming power today > consuming power in future -> people don't save
**** income, consumption, and value
- "value": buyer and seller agree on a pricen
- voluntary exchange
- "creation of value", "loss of value", court judgment, § 104(a)
- how much a buyer values an item
- "buyer surplus"
- how much seller values an item
- "seller surplus"
- "cooperative surplus"
- 
- taxing a buyer
- "personal consumption"
- deductibility
- things that a person MUST purchase
- 
- taxing a seller
- what kind of goods/services should sellers sell?
- whatever maximizes their "seller surplus"
- suppose tax on good A is higher than tax on good B
- this might distort what seller chooses to sell
- we don't want this
- SO!
- tax sellers only on "net income", not "gross proceeds"
- § 162: deduction for "ordinary and necessary trade or business expenses"
- cost of "productive inputs" should not be taxed
- "productive inputs" over a long period of time, depreciation, spread costs over the long period of "consumption" of the "productive input", §§ 167, 168
- 
- activities that "create value" v. activities that are "zero-sum game"
- gambling
- should not have "negative tax" (get money from govt)
- 
- aside: 3 principles of tax
		- (1) one income is taxed once and only once
		- (2) some exceptions exist, explicitly said in the code
		- (3) "basis", adjustment, treating "untaxed income" as if it had been taxed
- 
- "after-tax value"
- "neutral" tax code, "tax neutrality"
- "tax policy"
		- don't tax all "income" equally
		- encourage "earning money in a certain way" or "spending money in a certain way"
- letting A pay less means: govt gives up money or B pays more to make up for the subsidy
- 
- aside: tax cuts and jobs act
- got rid of some deductions (alimony paid)
- suspended some deductions (moving expenses)
- doubled standard deduction
- mp: more people (slightly less poorer people now)  will do "standard deduction" rather than "itemize"
- standard deductors: don't care about getting deductions through "items"
- so, they don't care about charity, etc.
- itemized deductors: enough money that they prefer to do itemized rather than standard
- 
- deviation from neutrality
- increasing "nation's wealth"
- "capture" of "cooperative surplus"
- suppose an employer-employee relationship
- an employer might get more/most of the "tax savings"
**** basis, or keeping score with the government
- aside: the essence of basis
- "adjusted basis"
		- I already paid tax on this, I don't have to pay tax on it again
- "taxpayer's basis"
- 
- § 61(a)(3), "gross income" includes "gains derived" from "dealings in property"
- "gains derived from dealings in property"
		- [price sold] - [price bought]
- why do we care about subtracting [price bought]?
- "adjusted basis"
- is this thing I bought "consumption" or just a different form of "holding wealth"?
- "income", "additional increment to wealth", "consumption", "wealth held"
- § 1001(a), "measure of gains derived from dealing in property"
		- "amount realized"
		- "adjusted basis"
- § 1012(a) "basis"
		- "basis in something"
		- what that something cost
- § 1011(a), "adjusted basis"
		- "store of property rights"
- "basis": how much of the dollar value of something has been taxed already
- 
- aside: investment, basis, depreciation, and adjustments to basis
- changei n form of holding "after tax wealth"
- "taxable event"
- assigning basis to an asset
- "income-producing consumption"
- "de-investment"
- "income-producing consumption" is deductible, § 162
- "depreciation", "amortization", "cost recovery"
- "de-investment", reduction in adjusted basis of income-producing asset
**** SHS accounting for spending savings
- suppose I take $10 from my savings, and buy a hamburger and eat it
- did I have "income" to be "income tax'ed"?
- 
- aside: the relationship between [basis] and [deductions from taxable income]
- "adjusted basis"
		- income that's already been taxed
- "deduction"
		- reduction in "taxable income" because the way I spent money pleased Congress
- deductions are only allowed if taxpayer has a "tax basis"
- money spent to get myself to a soup kitchen to volunteer: deductible
- my services that the soup kitchen didn't pay for: NOT deductible
**** borrowing money
- loan:
		- $100
		- obligation to repay $100
- these 2 are offset
- so, no impact on GI
- 
- I get a loan of $100
- I buy a house for $100
- I get a basis of $100 in the house
- is this "free basis"?
- no
- I actually end up paying $100
- over time, from "future income"
- this "future income" WILL be taxed
- I get the basis up front, pay for it over time
- repayment of "loan principal" is never deductible
- sometimes, [cost of borrowing] (interest) is deductible
- 
- aside: building a stronger economy
- people invest more -> economy grows
- cost of borrowing goes down -> more people borrow
- rephrase: price of money goes down -> more people buy money
- "not taxing loan proceeds"
- "permitting a taxpayer to use loan proceeds to acquire basis"
- reduces the cost of borrowing
- so, economy grows
** Wrap up questions
** what have you learned?
- tax base, deductions, exclusions, income phaseouts
		- "tax base"
				- total amount of assets or income that can be taxed by the government
		- "deductions from taxable income"
				- ?? deductions v. exemptions
						- exclusion: lower your GI
						- deduction: lower your TI (or AGI)
		- "exclusions from gross income"
				- "accessions to wealth" that are NOT used for GI
		- "income phaseouts"
				- suppose a tax credit
				- higher your income -> less you get of this tax credit
- tax formula, credit against tax
		- "tax formula"
				- GI - deductions = AGI
				- AGI - deductions = TI
				- [TI & rates] - credits = TL
		- "credits against tax"
				- lower "tax liability"
- progressive tax rates
		- the more you make, the more taxes you pay
- marginal tax rates
		- the tax rate of the next/last dollar
- upside-down nature of deductions and exclusion
		- marginal tax bracket
		- principle: higher your marginal tax bracket, the less you get from your next dollar
		- this principle & deductions
		- principle: higher your marginal tax bracket, the more you get from deducting a dollar
		- one way to see it:
		- the higher your marginal tax bracket, the more benefit you get by getting employment benefits excluded from gross income
		- "upside-down": results are the opposite of what policy-makers desire
- right-side up nature of tax credits
		- tax credit of 20% of what you spent on child care
		- deduction of what you spent on child care, and your marginal tax bracket is 20%
		- Congress: I want to encourage people to buy childcare. I care about poor people buying childcare. I don't care about rich people buying childcare.
		- suppose marginal tax bracket 1: 10%; marginal tax bracket 2: 20%
		- [credit, 15%, on child care] v. [deduction]
		- $100 on child care
		- deduction:
				- marginal 1: $10. saved $10.
				- marginal 2: $20. saved $20.
		- credit, 15%
				- $15. saved $15.
		- poor person saved more than he would have with a straight deduction
		- rich person saved less than he would have with a straight deduction
		- "right side up": the effect is what was intended
- employment taxes
		- a bunch of taxes that ALL employer and employees pay
		- social security; medicare; additional medicare; federal unemployment; worker's compensation
- the Tax Code, regulations, revenue rulings, revenue procedures, private letter rulings
		- "tax code" aka "Internal Revenue Code"
				- statutes that Congress enacted
				- enforced by IRS
		- "regulations"
				- Secretary of the Treasury's interpretation of the law
				- but, is actually law
		- "revenue ruling"
				- IRS's interpretation of law
		- "revenue procedures"
				- IRS: "hey, we're gonna do this if this issue comes up"
		- "private letter ruling"
				- legal advice that IRS gives to a private citizen
				- these are binding for IRS and the private citizen
- tax disputes and the Tax Court, the Court of Claims, and the Federal District Court
		- "tax disputes"
		- Tax Court
				- kind of like a district court, but for [topic of tax] rather than [specific geographic region]
				- can go here before paying
		- court of claims
				- claims against US
		- federal district court
				- jury
- tax norms of horizontal equity, vertical equity, and administrative feasibility
		- "horizontal equity"
				- taxpayers with equal "accessions to wealth" should pay the same amount of income tax
				- like taxpayers should be taxed alike
		- "vertical equity"
				- taxpayers with different "accessions to wealth" should NOT pay the same amount of income tax
				- unlike taxpayers should NOT be taxed alike
				- those with more accessions to wealth should pay more in (1) dollar amount AND (2) % of their income
		- "administrative feasibility"
				- rules should be easy to understand and to apply, for both taxpayer and IRS
- Schanz-Haig-Simons definition of income and its elements
		- SHS's "income"
				- sum of
				- (1) market value of rights exercised in consumption
				- (2) [change in value of "store of property rights"] between the [beginning and end of the period in question]
		- elements
				- (1) Income
				- (2) Consumption
				- (3) additions to the "store of property rights"
- three guiding principles of the income tax
		- (1) we tax income of a taxpayer once, and only once
		- (2) exceptions (income that's taxed 0 or more than once) are explicitly defined
		- (3) suppose some income is NOT taxed:
				- we don't see it as: "not income"
				- we see it as: "income to be taxed, it's just that "adjustment to basis" cancels it out"
- tax expenditures
		- "tax expenditure"
				- govt: hey taxpayer, I'll let you not pay tax on this because I like that you did it
				- this can be seen as "govt didn't tax at all"
				- can also be seen as "govt SPENT the money it WOULD have received"
				- "expenditure", "spending"
- income tax treatment of personal expenditures
		- § 267(a): no deduction for "personal consumption"
		- "personal consumption": fex: expenditures for basic living expenses
		- "personal": implies NOT deductible; a LEGAL conclusion
		- ?? purchasing choices, income that was already taxed, denying deductions for personal consumption, choices being unfettered, purchases that a taxpayer has no option NOT to make ??
- tax neutrality, distortion
		- "tax neutrality"
				- tax code treats ALL incomes alike, regardless of how it is earned or spent
		- "distortion"
				- departure from the allocation resources from which each agent maximizes his own welfare
				- fex: proportional income tax discourages working -> distrots;
				- fex: lump sum income tax does NOT distort
- basis
		- "basis"
				- purchase price
				- original cost of property
				- the part of a [property's value] that's SAVINGS, not income
				- suppose I earn $120
				- I pay $20 in tax, and now have $100
				- I buy a property for $100
				- I see the property for $150
				- what's my income?
				- it's not $150, because I already had $100
				- I profitted $50, not $150
				- so, my income from this sale is $50
		- "adjusted tax basis"
				- tax basis + depreciation
				- "savings that remain from income that has already been taxed"
- tax treatment of loans
		- suppose I borrow $100
		- is this "income"?
		- it DOES increase my wealth - so, it's an "accession to wealth"
		- so, yes it IS income
		- BUT!
		- the idea of borrowing: I get $100 now, I pay back $100 (at least) later
		- "pay back $100 later" is DECREASE in "store of property rights"
		- the [increase in wealth] and [decrease in wealth] cancel each other out
		- "principal"
				- $100
		- repayment of principal is NOT "deductible"
				- ?? I need to understand this better. what is "deductible", conceptually?
		- "interest"
				- $10
		- cost of borrowing, interest, is sometimes deductible
